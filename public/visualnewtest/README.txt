DESIGN REFERENCE FOLDER
=======================

Place your inspiration screenshot in this folder.

Supported formats: .png, .jpg, .jpeg, .webp

The first image file found in this folder will be used as the
design inspiration for ALL website generation and remix operations.

HOW IT WORKS:
1. Add your screenshot (e.g., "inspiration.png")
2. The system will analyze it using Gemini 3 Pro Preview
3. Extracted design patterns will guide all website generation
4. Analysis is cached until you replace the image

WHAT GETS EXTRACTED:
- Layout patterns (hero style, grid, spacing, nav)
- Color scheme (dominant, accent, background colors)
- Typography (heading style, weight, font)
- Component styles (buttons, cards, images)
- Effects (animations, shadows, gradients, glassmorphism)
- Tailwind class recommendations

The cache file (_cache.json) is automatically generated and
will be recreated if you change the inspiration image.
